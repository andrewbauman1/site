A collection of personal projects and experiments I've built over the years. I hope to post about each of these topics in more detail soon! (ETA: Spring 2026)

## Homelab Setup

My infrastructure for testing, development, and automation running on local hardware. Docker-based services handle media management, photo backup, automation, and development environments. Network segmentation, secure remote access, and RAID storage mean I can experiment without turning "what if..." into a recovery project.
It's where I test configurations, build automation scripts, and learn new technologies before anything sees production. Currently expanding automation workflows and refining monitoring solutions - enough complexity to learn from, enough safeguards to break things safely.

## Apple II Archive

Preserving programming manuals and documentation for the original [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_(original)). I've restored an Apple II to working condition and I'm building a backlog of utilities and experiments in Applesoft BASIC and 6502 assembly. There's something satisfying about working within 48KB of RAM and figuring out how programmers solved problems with those constraints.
Planning to publish a repository of digitized manuals, code samples, and programming notes - the kind of documentation that's slowly disappearing from the internet. Equal parts preservation project and programming time machine.

Inspired by sites & people like [Apple2History](https://www.apple2history.org/), [Apple II Library 4am](https://archive.org/details/apple_ii_library_4am), [VintageApple](https://vintageapple.org/apple_ii/), [Vince Weaver](http://www.deater.net/weave/vmwprod/apple/)

## Knowledge Management System

Personal and professional [LogSeq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq) graphs that serve as my external brain. The personal graph is where everything lands first: recipes I want to try, script fragments that solve one-off problems, project ideas in various states of half-baked, meeting notes, book highlights, and general brain dumps. It's organized chaos that somehow makes sense when I need to find that thing I wrote down six months ago.

The professional graph is more structured. It's optimized for technical project management with templates for implementation timelines, stakeholder communications, decision logs, and technical documentation. I'm currently refining this as a framework to publish for other Technical PMs who work in similarly complex environments. *(Coming Soon)*

## Personal CRM

Built on top of the open-source [TwentyCRM](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty) project and customized for our household. Tracks home inventory, financial data, and personal/professional relationships. It's basically everything I was trying to manage across five different tools. Turns out when you build it yourself, you actually use it.
