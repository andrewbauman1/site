I am committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. I am continually improving the user experience for everyone and applying the relevant accessibility standards to ensure I provide equitable access to all users.

## Measures to Support Accessibility

To ensure accessibility, I take the following measures:

- **Incorporate accessibility into the design and development process.**
- **Use tools and resources to test and improve accessibility.**
- **Provide ongoing training and education on accessibility best practices.**
- **Engage with the community to gather feedback and make improvements.**

## Conformance Status

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) define requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. WCAG outlines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. **drewsiph.dev** aims to conform to WCAG 2.1 Level AA, though some areas of the site may not fully meet this standard at all times.

### Known Limitations

- **Experimental Features:** As I frequently experiment with new features and designs on the site, some parts may not be fully accessible during testing or implementation phases.
- **Third-Party Content:** Some content or functionality provided by third-party tools or integrations may not fully conform to accessibility standards.

I am actively working to address these limitations and improve the overall accessibility of the site.

## Feedback

I welcome your feedback on the accessibility of **drewsiph.dev**. If you encounter any accessibility barriers or have suggestions for improvement, please let me know.

You can report accessibility issues by:
- [Opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/andrewbauman1/site/issues/new).
- Sending an email to hello[at]andrewbauman[dot]me.

I aim to respond to feedback within **10 days** and will make every effort to address your concerns promptly.

## Technical Specifications

Accessibility of **drewsiph.dev** relies on the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

These technologies are used in combination with accessibility features to ensure the site is as accessible as possible.

## Assessment Approach

I assess the accessibility of **drewsiph.dev** through:
- **Self-evaluation:** Regular manual and automated testing using tools like [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/), [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/), and browser developer tools.
- **User feedback:** Listening to and addressing concerns raised by users.
